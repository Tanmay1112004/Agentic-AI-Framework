        "\n",
        "### **Q1: What is Phidata, and how does it simplify agentic AI development?**  \n",
        "**A**: Phidata (now Agno AGI) is a framework to build **autonomous, multi-modal AI agents** with minimal code. It provides built-in support for **memory, tools, multi-agent teams, RAG, structured outputs, and a debugging UI**‚Äîall while keeping code elegant and simple. For example, a web-search agent takes just 10 lines.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q2: How does Phidata handle multi-agent collaboration?**  \n",
        "**A**: Phidata allows you to define **specialized agents** (e.g., Researcher, Writer) and orchestrate them into a **team workflow**. Agents can pass messages, request help, or validate each other‚Äôs work‚Äîenabling complex problem-solving through collaboration, similar to human teams.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q3: What is Agentic RAG, and how is it different from standard RAG?**  \n",
        "**A**: Standard RAG **blindly injects** retrieved context into a prompt. **Agentic RAG** (in Phidata) lets the agent **decide when and what to retrieve** based on its reasoning. For example: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know the answer ‚Üí I‚Äôll search the knowledge base for ‚ÄòQ3 revenue‚Äô.‚Äù This makes responses more accurate and grounded.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q4: Can Phidata agents process images? How?**  \n",
        "**A**: Yes! Phidata supports **multi-modal agents** by default. You can create an agent that accepts image inputs and uses vision-capable models (like GPT-4o or Gemini) to analyze them. Example: ‚ÄúDescribe this UI screenshot and suggest improvements.‚Äù\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q5: How would you debug a failing Phidata agent?**  \n",
        "**A**: Phidata provides **built-in monitoring**:  \n",
        "- View the agent‚Äôs **reasoning steps**,  \n",
        "- See **tool calls and outputs**,  \n",
        "- Check **errors or hallucinations**.  \n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q6: Why choose Phidata over LangChain for agent development?**  \n",
        "**A**: While LangChain is flexible, it‚Äôs **verbose and low-level**. Phidata offers:  \n",
        "- Cleaner, more **elegant syntax**,  \n",
        "- **Built-in multi-agent orchestration**,  \n",
        "- **Native UI and debugging**,  \n",
        "- **Agentic RAG out of the box**.  \n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q7: How do you ensure Phidata agents return structured data?**  \n",
        "**A**: Use **Pydantic models** or JSON schema in the agent definition. Phidata forces the LLM to output structured data, which can be directly used in apps or databases. Example:  \n",
