        "**A**: Generative AI generates content (text, images) based on prompts but is **passive**—it doesn’t act autonomously. Agentic AI **takes actions** to achieve goals: it plans, uses tools, executes tasks, and self-corrects. For example, GenAI can *describe* how to book a flight; Agentic AI *books the flight*.\n",

        "### **Q2: Explain the components of an Agentic AI system.**  \n",
        "**A**: Four core components:  \n",
        "1. **Reasoning Engine** (usually an LLM) to plan and decide.  \n",
        "2. **Tools** (APIs, code exec, databases) to interact with the world.  \n",
        "3. **Memory** to retain context across steps.  \n",
        "4. **Feedback Loop** to observe outcomes and adapt.  \n",

        "\n",
        "### **Q3: How does LangChain enable Agentic AI?**  \n",
        "**A**: LangChain provides **agents** that use LLMs to dynamically choose and invoke **tools** (e.g., Python REPL, search, custom functions). For example, if you ask, “What’s the average salary in sales.csv?”, the agent can auto-generate and run `df['salary'].mean()` without you writing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q4: What is LangGraph, and why is it important for agents?**  \n",
        "**A**: LangGraph extends LangChain to build **stateful, cyclic workflows**. Unlike linear chains, agents often need loops (e.g., “Draft → Review → Revise until approved”). LangGraph models these as **graphs**, enabling complex, human-like planning with memory.\n",

        "  2. Check transaction history (SQL query).  \n",
        "  3. If overcharged, issue refund (payment API).  \n",

        "- **Hallucinated Tool Use**: “Calling non-existent API.”  \n",

        "### **Q7: How do Agentic IDEs like Cursor change software development?**  \n",
        "**A**: They turn developers into **goal definers** rather than code writers. You describe *what* you want (“Add user login with OAuth”), and the agent writes, tests, and documents the code—accelerating development 5–10x while reducing boilerplate.\n",
