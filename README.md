# 🧠 Agentic-AI-Framework

An open-source **Agentic AI** framework designed to build autonomous, context-aware, and tool-using AI agents.  
This project showcases how LLMs can go beyond simple chatbots to perform **reasoning, decision-making, and execution** in real-world tasks.  

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧩 **Modular Agent Architecture** — Plug & play reasoning, memory, and tool components.  
- 🧠 **Cognitive Loop** — Agents that perceive, plan, act, and learn continuously.  
- 🛠️ **Tool Integration** — Seamless use of APIs, databases, and third-party tools.  
- 💬 **Multi-Agent Collaboration** — Agents that communicate and solve problems together.  
- 📚 **Memory System** — Contextual long-term + short-term memory for better reasoning.  
- 🌐 **LLM + Function Calling** — Integrate any LLM (OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Ollama, etc.)  
- 🧰 **Customizable Workflows** — Build specialized agents for analytics, business logic, or automation.
